Commands for the pre-packaged executable releases can be found in Test_suite_end_to_end.bat.
This file contains example of how you can use FluentDNA as a python package.  In most cases,
you'll need to provide a full path to fluentdna.py and the example_data/ directory in your
python site-pacakages.


# On Linux Systems, after installation, FluentDNA will be on your path and you can call the following commands from a terminal.
# Note that if you installed FluentDNA in a virtual environment, you will need to activate that first.

fluentdna.py --fasta="data/BATG-0.5__mitochondrion.fa" --outname="Multipart fasta test"
fluentdna.py --runserver
fluentdna.py "data/phiX.fa"

# To show gene annotations alongside your sequence, use --fasta= and --ref_annotation=
# an example is included in example_data/ under your DDV installation directory.
fluentydna.py --fasta="example_data/gnetum_sample.fa" --outname="Gnetum montanum - Example Annotation" --ref_annotation="example_data/Gnetum_sample_genes.gff"

# On Windows, you will need to execute the DDV2 script from the installation location.
# Note that if you installed DDV in a virtual environment, you will need to activate that first,
#    and change the path to the DDV2 script to match the path to your new environment location.

python3 DRIVE:\\python34\Lib\site-packages\DDV\fluentdna.py --fasta="data/BATG-0.5__mitochondrion.fa" --outname="Multipart fasta test"
python3 DRIVE:\\python34\Lib\site-packages\DDV\fluentdna.py --runserver
python3 DRIVE:\\python34\Lib\site-packages\DDV\fluentdna.py "data/phiX.fa"


# Mac Examples:
# These are commands tested by "will" (notice the path) and found to work.  They include the full path to the site-package to avoid
# an ambiguous lookup or "No module DDV" errors.  Edit these paths to match your computer.  
# Note that ptyhon 2.7 is the system default, but DDV is programmed to run in Python3.

# Running DDV that is directly installed to the system default "python3" environment
